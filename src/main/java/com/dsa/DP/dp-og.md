**Usually, solving and fully understanding a dynamic programming problem is a 4 step process:**

> Start with the recursive backtracking solution <br>
> Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down2 dynamic programming) <br>
> Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming) <br>
> Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity <br>
