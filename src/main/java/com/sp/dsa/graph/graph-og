**Check conditions**

Grid
-> no union find
dfs (w/ visited)
bfs

-> with edge weights (adj matrix), else adj list
-> shortest time/path (BFS w/ pruning)
-> order/loop (Topo, Dfs w/ coloring / Kahn's)
-> traversal/count (Dfs)
-> If no edge weights, prefer dfs

Undirected
-> loop/components (union find)
-> bipartite (bfs/union find)
-> count (dfs)
